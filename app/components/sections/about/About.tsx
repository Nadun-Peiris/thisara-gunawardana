        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Thisara Gunawardana, a passionate filmmaker and creative video
          director with over 8+ years of experience in videography, filmmaking,
          and visual storytelling.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey in the media industry started as a production assistant and
          evolved into directing, filming, and editing high-quality content for
          brands, entertainment companies, and digital platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe every story deserves to be told creatively and authentically.
          My strength lies in understanding client visions, transforming ideas
          into compelling visuals, and delivering content that connects
          emotionally with audiences.
